=== What is GitHub?

* *GitHub != Git*, ie, GitHub is not Git.
    ** Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history.
    ** *GitHub is a hosting service for Git link:index.html#_repository[repositories].*
    ** So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.
