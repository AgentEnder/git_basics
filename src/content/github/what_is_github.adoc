=== What is GitHub?

* *GitHub != Git*, ie, GitHub is not Git.
    ** Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history.
    ** *GitHub is a hosting service for Git link:#_repository[repositories].*
    ** So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.

* https://github.com/[GitHub] is just one such service for Git. Other prominent services include GitLab, Bitbucket, Git Kraken, etc.
