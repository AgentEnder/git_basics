=== Working Tree

* It notes the untracked files in the working directory/copy - a copy of the most recent state of the files one is working on.
* Any changes to files will be marked and seen in the Working Tree.
* Here if one makes changes and does not explicitly save them to git, they will lose the changes made to their files.
* If one makes changes to files in their working tree, git will recognize that the files are modified. But until one tells git “Hey pay attention to these files,” it won’t save anything that goes on in them. This is done with `git add {file_name}`
