=== git merge

==== Command

`git merge <branch_name>`

==== Description

The `git merge` command's primary responsibility is to combine separate branches and resolve any conflicting edits.

Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

The `git merge` command lets you take the independent lines of development created by link:index.adoc#_git_branch[`git branch`] or link:index.adoc#_git_checkout[`git checkout`] and integrate them into a single branch.

Preparing to merge:

    * Make sure to be in the branch (`link:index.adoc#_git_checkout[git checkout] <receiving_ranch>`) you want to merge another branch into (let this branch be called `receiving_branch`).
    * Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes.
    * Merge using `git merge <merging_branch>`
    * Eg: If you want to merge the 'feature' branch into the 'master' branch, run `git checkout master` (if you aren't already in the master branch, ie, if your HEAD points to another branch) and then run `git merge feature`.

Merges are of mainly two types:

    * Fast forward merges (usually for small and short develop-duration features)
    * Three way merges (usually for long ranging tasks and features)
