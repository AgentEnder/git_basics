==== Command

`git commit <flags_&_options>`

==== Prequisites

The following terms are required to be understood:

* link:index.adoc#_staging_staging_areaindex[Staging (staging area/index)]
* link:index.adoc#_sha1[SHA1]

==== Description

A commit is simply a checkpoint telling Git to track all changes that have occurred up to the current point using the last commit as a comparison.

A commit is carried out only if there are files in the staging area, so make sure to run link:index.adoc#_git_add[`git add`] before this command.

Every commit has a *commit message* associated with it which describes the overall change made.

TIP: Short, crisp and to-the-point commit messages are preferred (<50 characters).

TIP: Use the imperative, present tense ('change', not 'changed' or 'changes') in commit messages to be consistent with generated messages from commands like `git merge`. Eg: `git commit -m "Update README.md"`

If extra information is needed to be given, add it to the *description* of the commit.

Every commit has a unique *SHA1* associated with it.

Use link:index.adoc#_git_log[`git log`] & link:index.adoc#_git_show[`git show`] commands to get information on commits. 

IMPORTANT: Always pull before committing & pushing.

TIP: Commit _related_ changes.

TIP: Commit changes frequently. This makes it easier to revert back to older versions to correct mistakes.

TIP: _Don't_ commit half-done or incomplete work.
