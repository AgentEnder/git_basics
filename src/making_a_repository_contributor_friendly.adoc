== Making a Repository Contributor Friendly

Open source is all about opening up projects for the community to use and contribute to! Contributions are a very important aspect of open source. Contributions help the community in improving software/projects that they use, for themselves and others.

To make contributions easier, the following files/tools are used in a repository

    * link:index.html#_readme_md[`README.md`]
    * link:index.html#_contributing_md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`]
    * link:index.html#_license[`LICENSE`]
    * link:index.html#_code_of_conduct[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`]
    * link:index.html#_issues[Issues]

They are discussed below.
